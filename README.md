# Crop-Leaf-Disease-Detection
Crop leaf disease detection using CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) is a deep learning approach that automates the identification of diseases in crop leaves. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of healthy and diseased leaf images, enabling it to classify and detect diseases in real-time, assisting farmers in timely disease management.
